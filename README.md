# Doggo Mod

Doggo Mod is a mod that changes the behavior of Minecraft dogs (tamed wolves) to allow them to have more of a personality.

It also adds dog bowls for a dog to eat from and a little tennis ball to play fetch.

**Warning! Currently this mod only works in Singleplayer and I don't know if it will ever work in Multiplayer. Issues that I'm running into are very weird and difficult to fix.**

## Blocks and items

This mod adds:
- Dog bowls
- Tennis ball

### Dog Bowl

There are 16 differently colored dog bowls each one crafted with its dye.

Any dog if close enough will eat from it if there is food inside it... if not then the dog will be sad.

You can rename the dog bowl using an anvil to only allow dogs with the same name to eat from it.

It will also display the name on the side of the dog bowl.

### Tennis Ball

A little toy for a dog.

You can throw it by right-click it.

If you don't throw it far away from a dog, it will come to it, grab it and bring it back to its owner.

## Behavior

This mod doesn't make any drastic changes to the dog's behavior.

Here is a list of behaviour changes
- Added an ability for a dog to dig
- Added an ability for a dog to hold an item in its mouth
- Added an ability for a dog to scratch its ear
- Added an ability for a dog to take a nap
- Changed the way to heal a dog

### Digging

From time to time a dog may start digging... if you give it some time it may also find some treasure.

### Healing

There are two ways to heal a dog

1. Place down a dog bowl and put food (preferably meat) in it by right-clicking on the dog bowl. If a dog is near a dog bowl and it's not on max health, it will try eating from it.
2. You can give food (preferably meat) to a dog by right-clicking on it. The dog will then hold it in its mouth and eat whenever it wants to.

### Holding an item

A dog can hold an item in its mouth at any time... but don't expect it to hold a sword.

### Napping

If you leave a dog sitting and walk a way, it will lay down and take a nap.

### Scratching its ear

From time to time a dog may scratch its ear.
